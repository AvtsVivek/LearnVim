# Welcome to Learn Vim!

I built this plugin as a companion to _Boost Your Coding Fu With VSCode and Vim_ so that you can read and practice along right from within your favorite code editor.

Use the panel on the left to select the chapter you're most interested in. If you're new to Vim and VSCodeVim I suggest that you start from the beginning. When you select a chapter, an editor like this one will magically materialize out of thin air with instructions and exercises that you can use to practice your Vim skills!

Have fun! :D
